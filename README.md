Step 1. Make sure that the file "storedGames.json" exists. If it doesn't, do step 2.
Step 2. Create "storedGames.json" with this line of code: archive.create_json("storedGames"). This code has inline comments in main.py. You can just remove the # for it to create a file. The code is at the right place already.
Step 3. Make sure the file is at the right path, because I use a Macbook Air the path to the file and it's functions may differ. If you for example use a different OS.
